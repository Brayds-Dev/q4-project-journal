## Individual Reflective Journal

**Project Planning and Proposal Stage** <br />

In this stage of the project I took on the role of Scrum master.
I would organise the meetings set meeting agendas and record the meeting minutes.
I created the kanban board and during each meeting we would run through which task we were doing or had completed and update the kanban board accordingly. <br/>

During this stage I also created the design mock-ups for the website <br/>
<br/>

**Key Decisions** <br/>

The adding of a back-end authentication system for an account section where only logged in users can contact the foundation directly.
<br/>
Involved heavily in the decision based around which tech stack to use.
<br/>
Decided on the general design theme to be used throughout the website.
<br/>


**Design Commentary**
<br/>

Coming up with the general theme and color of the website is but one of the design features I was involved in. We had already been given the logo design of the company and I wanted to inherit some of the logos look and feel and continue it through to the website. As this website is for a foundation looking after babies, I decided to incorporate light blueâ€™s and pinks as I believed that would represent colors usually associated with babies.
<br/>

Below are some screen shots of the websites mock-ups.

**Reflection on the Teamwork**
<br/>
As a team I believe we communicated effectively and always made sure that each team member had a task to do. Using Microsoft Teams as our main communication portal worked really well. Also having concise meeting meeting minutes allowed any team member to reference back what was needed of them and also if a team member was not present at the meeting they could use the meeting minutes file to catch up on what may have been missed.
<br/>
We used Whiteboard as a collaboration tool for any design ideas and notes but I feel as an improvement we could have used this more in having each team member brainstorm on key design decisions to help make the most out of having multiple ideas and views on what the product will and feel like.
<br/>

**Cultural Issues Addressed**
<br/>
As this website is being built for a voluntary foundation whose sole focus is preventing newborn infants from being abanndoned or simply dumped in the streets of Namibia, it will not only help raise awareness of this real life cultural and social issue but will also help provide a means for anyone worldwide to do their part in helping make sure this does not happen.
